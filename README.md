# telnet-socket
A standards compliant Telnet implementation for Node.js

## Standards
In addition to [RFC 854](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc854), a number of additional RFCs, proposed RFCs, and adopted options such as [GMCP](https://www.gammon.com.au/gmcp) are implemented. An emphasis on standards used with ANSI-BBS related terminals is taken, though PRs are certainly welcome if something of use is missing.

See [./lib/telnet_spec.js](telnet_spec.js) for more information.
